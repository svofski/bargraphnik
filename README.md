This is an undocumented ill-fated project. It's really beautiful, but I failed somewhere in the circuit design and it burned several times. Do not reuse this circuit blindly.

Software part is good and hopefully it can be useful. Instead of typical FFT analyzer, I'm using a set of biquad bandpass filters. This allows for
extremely fast response time.
